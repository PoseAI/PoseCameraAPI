Keeping a note here of the main differences between UE5 vs UE4 version builds for quick conversion. 
TBD: Can we do this with compiler defines that the build system recognizes and avoid having 4 versions of the plugin?

PoseAiMediaFramework.cpp
The UPoseAIMediaComponent::TickComponent method generates a FMediaTextureResource.  In UE4 this was MediaTexture->Resource, in UE5 MediaTexture->GetResource()

PoseAIUdpSocketReceiver.h
In Update method, in 4.0 we use UTF8_TO_TChar to make the FString (not as safe as desired, has been crash prone in past), in 5.0 we use a newer (and safer) FString constructer.

PoseAILiveLinkBuild.cs
UE5 requires LiveLinkAnimationCore in PublicDependencies.  Inclusion is automatically handled with code.
